# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Workspace

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. The goal is to provide a hands-on environment for learning, practicing, and solving problems related to DSA.

## Structure

-   `linked_list/`
    -   `singly_linked_list/`
        -   `main.py`: Basic singly linked list operations
        -   `problems.py`: Practice problems and interview-style questions
    -   `doubly_linked_list/`
        -   `main.py`: Basic doubly linked list operations
        -   `problems.py`: Practice problems and interview-style questions
-   `stack/`
    -   `main.py`: Stack implementation and usage
    -   `problems.py`: Stack-related problems and exercises
-   `queue/`
    -   `main.py`: Queue implementation and usage
    -   `problems.py`: Queue-related problems and exercises
-   `tree/`
    -   `main.py`: Binary tree and related operations

## Usage

Each module can be run independently to test and explore different data structures.  
Example:

```sh
python linked_list/singly_linked_list/main.py
python stack/main.py
```

## Purpose

-   Practice and reinforce DSA concepts
-   Prepare for coding interviews
-   Build a reference for common data structure operations

## Contributing

Feel free to fork and add new data structures, algorithms, or problems!
